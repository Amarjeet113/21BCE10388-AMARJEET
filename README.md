Hereâ€™s a README file tailored for your WebSocket-based chess-like game, integrating both the client-side React component and the server-side WebSocket server.


# Chess-Like Game with WebSocket

## Description
This project is a real-time chess-like game that allows two players to play against each other using WebSocket for real-time communication. The game board and player moves are synchronized across clients using WebSocket.

## Features
- Real-time updates of game state and player moves
- Basic win and draw conditions
- Simple chess-like game mechanics
- Player turn management

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with WebSocket
- **Styling**: CSS

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-like-game.git
Navigate into the project directory:


cd chess-like-game
Install dependencies:

For the client:

cd client
npm install
For the server:

cd server
npm install
Usage
Start the WebSocket server:


cd server
node server.js
Start the React client:


cd client
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

How It Works
Frontend (client/src/WebSocketConnection.js):

Connects to the WebSocket server.
Handles game state updates and player interactions.
Allows players to start the game and make moves.
Backend (server/server.js):

Manages WebSocket connections and broadcasts game state to all connected clients.
Handles game initialization, player moves, and win/draw conditions.
Game Flow
Players connect to the WebSocket server and provide their player ID.
Players initialize the game by sending their characters' positions.
Players can make moves, which are broadcast to all clients.
The server validates moves, updates the game state, and notifies clients of game state changes or errors.
